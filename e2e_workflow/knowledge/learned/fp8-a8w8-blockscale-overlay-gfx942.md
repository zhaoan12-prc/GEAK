# fp8 a8w8 blockscale GEMM → per-(N,K) M-bucketed Triton config-JSON overlay  (DEPRECATED — see banner)
- lever: the live seam is `aiter.ops.triton.gemm_a8w8_blockscale`. Stock has NO per-(N,K) config for
  the model's large shapes → it uses a generic tile = headroom. Win = drop a tuned
  `gfx942-GEMM-A8W8_BLOCKSCALE-N=<N>-K=<K>.json` into `aiter/ops/triton/configs/gemm/`
  (winner_kind=**patch**; `AITER_TRITON_CONFIGS_PATH` is `__file__`-fixed, not env-overridable).
- apply: **M-bucket the config** — tile shape depends on (N,K):
  · wide-N up/gate (N=34816,K=5120): prefill BM=256/BN=128/GROUP_M=4/nw=8.
  · K-heavy/narrow-N down (N=5120,K=17408): prefill **BM=128/BN=256**/GM=4/nw=8 (widen BN, keep BM).
  · square-ish qkv/o (N=5120,K=6144): prefill BM=256/BN=128/GM=4/nw=8 (small clean win).
  · decode (M≤1024) MUST stay generic BM=128. Integrator must rebind BOTH `sglang...fp8_utils` globals
    `triton_gemm_a8w8_blockscale` + `gemm_a8w8_blockscale_bpreshuffle`.
- verify: honest in-process `config=` kwarg A/B, same synth fp8 operands held fixed, interleaved
  min-of-N; confirm engagement via live `_get_config(M,N,K)` (returns a (dict,use_persistent) tuple → [0]).
- caution: a FLAT overlay (BM=256 for all M) tanks decode 0.6–0.7× — decode MUST stay generic.
- caution: BN=256 + BM=256 together = LDS spill (0.29×) — widen only one dim.
- caution: on the **vLLM CK live path** (not Triton) this overlay does NOT apply — live is CK
  xdl-cshuffle; the lever there is env `AITER_CONFIG_GEMM_A8W8_BLOCKSCALE=<csv>`, but it yields ~1.00×
  (CK default heuristic already picks the optimal `256x128x128 intrawave_v3`). ALWAYS check which live
  path (CK vs Triton) is engaged BEFORE choosing the lever.
- caution: **backend availability is a PROVISIONING gate, not a no-win.** The mandated CK lever needs the
  aiter CK tuner (`csrc/ck_gemm_a8w8_blockscale/`); the FlyDSL alternative needs aiter's `aiter/ops/flydsl/`
  wrapper AND the top-level `flydsl` pip pkg. If `env_report.absent_backends` lists either, record the
  two-part remedy (flydsl: `pip install 'flydsl>=0.1.5'` AND a flydsl-enabled `amd_aiter` build that ships
  `aiter/ops/flydsl/` — pip flydsl ALONE is insufficient; `aiter.ops.flydsl` stays ModuleNotFoundError) and
  fall back to an available lever — never silently drop the head. See `gemm_tuning/fp8_gemm_tuning_sglang_aiter.md`.
- caution: the aiter `gemm_a8w8_blockscale_bpreshuffle` path benches ~1.5× faster than the plain
  Triton blockscale kernel BUT is WRONG as a naive drop-in (op_bench Qwen3-14B-FP8: rel_err 43.6 vs the
  blockscale baseline's 0.0075) — it needs weights preshuffled first. It is the large-M prefill lever,
  not a free swap; only use via the preshuffle seam (`aiter:gemm_a8w8_blockscale_bpreshuffle` + a once
  `shuffle_weight`), never by rebinding the live blockscale call to it directly.
- source: exp/e2e_*Qwen3.5-27B-FP8*/ runs 06-08 … 06-15 (11 re-confirms); + exp/e2e_qwen3_14b_fp8_20260624
  (13th: Qwen3-14B-FP8 TP=2, 4 per-GPU families. In-process config= A/B, fixed synth fp8 operands, min-of-50.
  Prefill M={13645,16385}: up/gate N=17408,K=5120 BM256/BN128/GM4/nw8 = 1.16×; qkv N=3584,K=5120 same = 1.15×;
  down N=5120,K=8704 BM256/BN128/GM1/nw8 = 1.09×; o N=5120,K=2560 BM256/BN128/GM4/nw8 = 1.09×; prefill geomean 1.11×.
  All correct (fp8 tol 0.06). BM128_BN256 LOST on every family here (default-class), reconfirming "widen BM not BN"
  for these K=5120-ish shapes. Decode kept generic via M_LEQ_1024 key. Overlay engagement re-verified live via
  get_gemm_config (BM 128→256 on prefill). aiter bpreshuffle benched 4.63 vs 6.48 ms (1.4×) but rel_err 41.8 = NOT a drop-in.)
  (12th: re-confirmed live seam + "not found tuned config, will use default config" headroom on up/gate
  N=17408,K=5120; aiter bf16 DB tune is the WRONG lever here — fp8 path is the Triton seam, not aiter.tuned_gemm)
