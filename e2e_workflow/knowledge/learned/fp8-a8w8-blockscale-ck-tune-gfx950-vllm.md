type: lever
confidence: ★★★
effect: e2e +16.1% / +65.69% / +18.86% on three models; iso 1.86–3.17× serving-weighted. Gain is gated by SHIPPED aiter table coverage — ~0 when the head shapes already bind tuned (measured 1.03× on a saturated model). Probe coverage before budgeting.

# gfx950 vLLM fp8 a8w8 blockscale — per-shape CK tune DB (no overlay needed)

- path: (1) probe the live seam + coverage — `AITER_LOG_TUNED_CONFIG=1`, count `use default` vs
  `is tuned`; (2) if AITER is OFF the live baseline is UNTUNED Triton `_w8a8_triton_block_scaled_mm`,
  so add the swap `VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER=1 VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER_LINEAR=1` (Triton→CK) — this is the
  dominant term, ~1.5× on its own; (3) tune the `use default` head shapes and deploy the DB — this
  recovers the prefill regression that default-CK introduces. No fp8_utils overlay and no code_patch:
  on vLLM the tuned CSV alone binds (unlike the sglang seam).
- expected gain: read it off step 1. All shapes `is tuned` → ~1.0×, skip the lever. Zero coverage →
  the full 1.86–3.17× serving-weighted, e2e-transferring at +16% to +65% depending on head share
  (67.96% GPU → +65.69%; 19.78% → +18.86%). Partial coverage → scale by the uncovered fraction.
  A broad aiter-linear swap can EXCEED the single-head Amdahl ceiling, since it re-routes every fp8
  blockscale linear rather than one kernel.
- apply: `csrc/ck_gemm_a8w8_blockscale/gemm_a8w8_blockscale_tune.py --libtype both --mp <all GPUs>`
  over the captured head (M,N,K) → tuned CSV, deployed as
  `AITER_CONFIG_GEMM_A8W8_BLOCKSCALE=<csv>`. Pre-merge your rows OVER the shipped table into one
  file — a bare path REPLACES aiter's merge and drops shipped coverage. ZERO extra HBM.
- verify: `is tuned on cu_num` for every head shape, errRatio 0. Parity rel_err ~2e-4 vs the fp32
  dequant oracle (<< TOL 0.05).
- caution: gains are prefill-driven (M=4096 ~3.3×; decode M1/M64 ~1.14×), so a decode-bound mix banks
  less than the serving-weighted figure — check the e2e gate, and extend the tune to small-M decode.
  Also verify parity on EVERY deploy: a re-run of the +18.86% lever read +16.79% but failed the
  integrate gate on output_corruption. Quote the +65.69% as a free-GPU number — a contended re-run of
  the same lever landed 1.067×. The +16.1% (Qwen3.5-27B) is the weakest of the three: parity n/a under
  the fp8 accuracy gate, tuned-shape binds unreproduced, and a server-flag bundle confounds it.
  If ckProfiler is absent the CK *author* lane is unavailable, but the tune DB still applies.
- confirm (2026-08-19, Qwen3-14B-FP8 TP1, gfx950/MI355, head 67.3% GPU): swap-only aiter-linear
  Triton->CK (VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER[_LINEAR]=1), UNTUNED CK, measured on the immutable unittest
  (`aiter.gemm_a8w8_blockscale`, non-transposed scale, parity rel~7e-3 << TOL 0.05): serving-weighted
  1.513x, geomean 1.28x. Regime split as the card warns — decode M1/M64 1.8-2.3x, prefill M571 REGRESSES
  0.66-0.84x (untuned CK). The per-shape CK tune (recovers prefill -> card's 1.86-3.17x) was NOT runnable
  here: the offline tuner `csrc/ck_gemm_a8w8_blockscale/gemm_a8w8_blockscale_tune.py` + ckProfiler are
  ABSENT from this image's aiter wheel (no csrc dir); foreign-checkout tuners exist on NFS but version-
  mismatch the installed aiter -> unsafe. So shipped swap-only; e2e prefill-regression risk left to the
  Integrator gate + operator-provisioned tuner.
