"""Emit sglang-dialect `step[...]` phase annotations from a live vLLM v1 server.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The KernelFusion semantics layer (`semantic_kernel_mapping.py`) attributes every device
event to a serving phase by locating it inside a **step span** on the GPU timeline.  It
recognizes exactly two dialects:

    step[EXTEND bs=8 toks=4096]        <- sglang's profiler annotation
    step[DECODE bs=64]
    execute_context_1024_generation_64 <- vLLM's `detailed_trace_annotation` (legacy)

Current vLLM emits NEITHER: `detailed_trace_annotation` aborts the server on builds whose
`ProfilerConfig` is a strict pydantic schema (see `adapters/vllm.sh`), and vLLM's own
`gpu_model_runner: forward` ranges carry no phase / batch-size / token-count. With no step
spans `_collect_step_spans()` returns empty, `_phase_at()` returns None for every launch,
NO phase-tagged table is built, and the whole fusion chain (candidates -> topk -> unitside
-> apply-back) loses its denominator.

So instead of teaching the parser a third dialect, we make vLLM SPEAK the first one: wrap
`GPUModelRunner.execute_model` in a `torch.profiler.record_function` whose name is
byte-identical to what sglang emits.  Everything downstream — the CPU/GPU dual-window
pairing, layer-boundary resolution, conservation checks — is reused verbatim.

`record_function` produces a `user_annotation` CPU event and, for the kernels launched
inside it, a correlated `gpu_user_annotation` device event.  That is the exact category
pair `_collect_step_spans()` reads.

CONTRACT
--------
- Inert unless `GEAK_VLLM_PHASE_ANNOTATE=1`. An unarmed overlay must not change a serving run.
- Never raises into the serving path. If the phase cannot be determined the original method
  is called with NO annotation — a MISSING span degrades to "unresolved", a WRONG span
  silently corrupts every fusion candidate built on it.
- Idempotent: re-installing on an already-wrapped class is a no-op.
- stderr only. stdout is parsed by the launcher; polluting it breaks the JIT banner scrape.
