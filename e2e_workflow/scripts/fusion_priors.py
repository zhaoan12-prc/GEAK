"""Fusion priors: the known-fusion cards in knowledge/learned, and the recall
gate that makes a run ACCOUNT for each of them.

Why this exists
---------------
On DSR1 the same model, the same trace and the same roles produced a different
fusion set on different runs. Nothing was broken -- the analyst simply
rediscovered the opportunity space from scratch each time, and rediscovery is
not deterministic. A fusion that landed +11.8% e2e in one run was never even
proposed in the next, and there was no artifact anywhere that said so, because
"never proposed" leaves no trace.

The fix is the same shape as every other gate in this pipeline: give the phase a
DENOMINATOR. `knowledge/learned/INDEX.md` already records the fusions we have
measured. Each such card is a PRIOR the run must dispose of explicitly -- carry
it as a candidate, or say in one line why it does not apply here. A prior that
is silently absent is exactly the run-to-run instability the user reported.

What a prior is NOT
-------------------
Not a mandate, and not a filter. Per `knowledge/learned/README.md` the KB is
ADD-only: a card may add a candidate to try, never remove one the profile found,
and never substitute for measurement. `not_applicable` with an honest reason is
a perfectly good disposition -- the gate is about the SENTENCE existing, not
about the answer being yes.
