# Backend-agnostic e2e serving benchmark dispatcher for e2e_workflow.
#
# ONE script the Director, Profiler, Config Tuner, and e2e Integrator all share so every throughput
# number is measured the SAME way (warm server, fixed ISL/OSL/conc, same lifecycle for both legs of
# every comparison). The serving STACK (sglang / vllm / ...) is NOT baked in here — it lives in
# scripts/adapters/<backend>.sh. This dispatcher owns only the stack-INDEPENDENT parts:
#   * server lifecycle (launch / health-wait / cleanup), or reuse of a warm server (REUSE_SERVER=1),
#   * warmup (never timed) + N timed rounds + optional bounded profiling trace,
#   * throughput summary (one machine-readable line + JSON).
#
# NUMBERS ARE ONLY COMPARABLE WITHIN ONE LIFECYCLE. warm_server reports a round against a server that
# has already served a full one, so it differs from the cold-cache isolated_server/legacy number for
# the SAME config by an amount whose sign and size are not predictable from the config alone: it rises
# with prefix-cache reuse, and a workload with little shared prefix can land either way (measured on
# DeepSeek-V4-Pro TP8, RANDOM_RANGE_RATIO=1.0 / ISL 8192: warm 826.9 vs isolated median 833.3 tok/s).
# So never ratio a warm_server leg against an isolated_server one, and never compare a number produced
# here against a pre-warm_server record (KB entries, old reports) — re-measure the reference instead.
# `bench_summary.json.measurement_mode` says which lifecycle produced any given number.
# It is config-driven by env so an agent can vary ONE axis at a time. Nothing is model-specific.
#
# GEAK_REPEAT_MODE picks the measurement lifecycle:
#   warm_server (default)  one server per leg; one full untimed round warms the prefix cache, then
#                     $REPEATS timed rounds on that hot server (median).  $REPEATS defaults to 1
#                     for every purpose, i.e. Hyperloom's warmup_round/measure_round protocol:
#                     two client passes, the second is the number.  Spread, if any, is WITHIN-server
#                     (client noise), not boot-to-boot.  1 boot per leg.
#   isolated_server   one FRESH server per timed replica (bench_replica.sh), median across
#                     replicas; spread bounds boot-to-boot variance.  N replicas = N cold boots,
#                     serialized behind the serving-GPU lock.
#   legacy            one server, short warmup, $REPEATS timed rounds, median.
# All three emit the same acceptance contract.
#
# The adapter contract (each scripts/adapters/<BACKEND>.sh must define):
#   adapter_default_port            -> echo a sensible default port for this stack
#   adapter_launch                  -> launch the server in background; set global SERVER_PID; write $LOG.
#                                      Reads: MODEL HOST PORT TP GPU MEM_FRACTION EXTRA_SERVER_ARGS
#                                             EXTRA_ENV OVERLAY_PYTHONPATH PROFILE PROFILE_DIR
#                                      MUST launch through the shared prefix:
#                                        ${SERVER_LAUNCH_PREFIX:-} env ... <server> ... & SERVER_PID=$!
#                                      That prefix (server_teardown.sh) puts the server in its OWN
#                                      session, which is the ONLY thing that lets teardown PROVE the
#                                      process group belongs to this launch and reap the whole tree.
#                                      An adapter that launches without it still works, but its
#                                      teardown degrades to pid+descendants. A launcher that cannot
#                                      control the launch (it delegates to an external script) must
#                                      instead set SERVER_GROUP_UNVERIFIED=1 unless it can show the
#                                      pid leads its own group.
#   adapter_health                  -> return 0 iff $BASE_URL is serving (e.g. curl /health)
#   adapter_bench  NUMP MAXC PROF   -> run ONE bench (random ISL/OSL), append a result JSON line to
#                                      $RESULT_JSONL with canonical keys (output_throughput,
#                                      median_ttft_ms, median_tpot_ms). PROF=1 => also emit a trace
#                                      into $PROFILE_DIR. Honors optional REQUEST_RATE (req/s; empty=inf)
#                                      to stagger arrivals.
#   adapter_profile_window          -> OPTIONAL. Capture a profiler window (record_shapes) on the
#                                      ALREADY-RUNNING, warm, mid-load server, so the trace is the real
#                                      steady-state prefill+decode MIX rather than a cold prefill ramp.
#                                      The window is sized per-backend: sglang by PROFILE_NUM_STEPS (its
#                                      /start_profile takes num_steps); vllm by PROFILE_WINDOW_SEC (its
#                                      /start_profile has no step count, so start->sleep->stop). If
#                                      undefined, the PROFILE step falls back to a (less faithful)
#                                      saturated PROF=1 bench.
#   adapter_prepare_measurement     -> OPTIONAL. Called after untimed warmup and before RESULT_JSONL
#                                      is cleared/timed. Return nonzero when backend JIT/compile state
#                                      cannot be proven stable; timed measurements then fail closed.
