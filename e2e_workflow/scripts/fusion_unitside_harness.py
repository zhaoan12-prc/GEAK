"""Phase 3.0: the 单侧 (isolated) gate for kernel-fusion candidates.

Deterministic validator of the per-candidate microbench VERDICTS produced by the
fusion_unit_validator role. It does NOT run kernels and claims no perf of its own —
it VALIDATES that each verdict is trustworthy (well-formed + provenance-consistent
with the Phase 2.1 candidate it claims to test) and derives the gate:

Every verdict is scored on TWO INDEPENDENT AXES, because collapsing them is how a
correct measurement of the wrong quantity gets closed as a refutation:

  correctness_status ∈ {pass, fail, not_engaged}   — did it compute the right answer?
  perf_status        ∈ {win, no_win, undefined}    — is it faster?

  * `perf_status` is `undefined` whenever `correctness_status != pass`, and
    `isolated_speedup` is nulled with it. A kernel that was fed wrong takes a wrong
    branch and a wrong tile config, so its `cand_ms` timed something that was never
    the candidate. "parity failed AND it was slow" is ONE fault counted twice.

  failure_kind ∈ {none, performance, functional, unmeasured, not_engaged} — and this
  is the field a human should read first, because it names WHICH KIND of failure:
  * performance — 功能失败? no. It computed the right answer and simply is not
    faster. This is the only verdict that may be closed on the spot.
  * functional  — it diverged AND the author recorded a `parity_diagnosis`, i.e. the
    mundane feeding causes were eliminated and the divergence is believed real.
  * unmeasured  — it diverged and nobody looked. NOT a result. The gate fails.
  * not_engaged — a collective whose size guard fell back to the split path; there
    is no fused execution to judge at this shape.

`unit_side_status` ∈ {pass, fail, blocked, needs_diagnosis} is DERIVED from the pair
and kept for the board/apply-back consumers:
  (pass, win) → pass · (pass, no_win) → fail · (fail, undefined) → needs_diagnosis ·
  (not_engaged, undefined) → blocked
Only `pass` is eligible for apply-back.

A verdict that is malformed, references an unknown candidate, tests a DIFFERENT shape
than the candidate captured, or names a fused_fn that is not the candidate's existing
API is an ERROR (untrustworthy → the harness FAILS so it is re-run) -- never silently a
pass. This is the anti-cheat that keeps 单侧 honest, mirroring the provenance checks in
fusion_candidate_harness.py.

COVERAGE (recall) gate
----------------------
The checks above are all *precision*: they ask whether a SUBMITTED verdict is
trustworthy. They cannot see a candidate for which no verdict was ever submitted,
because the validator loops over verdicts, not over candidates. A run that
microbenched 16 of 42 candidates therefore rendered as
"总计 16 条 verdict：pass 16 / fail 0 ... status=pass" -- a 38%-coverage run that is
indistinguishable from a complete one. Observed on DSR1 2026-08-26: the highest
roofline decode candidate (kv_write_cluster) and all 20 prefill candidates silently
never reached the microbench, and nothing anywhere turned red.

So the denominator is now explicit. Every candidate that CITES an existing fused API
(i.e. is 单侧-testable at all) must end up in exactly one of:

  * a real verdict (pass / fail / blocked), or
  * an explicit `--waive <candidate_id>=<reason>` (status `waived`), or
  * `not_validated` → the harness FAILS.

tier-C candidates (`implementation_class: new_helper_kernel`, i.e. no existing kernel
to bench) are reported as `deferred_author` and are legitimately out of scope -- they
are counted and shown, never silently dropped. Pass `--allow-partial-coverage` to
report the gap without failing (the gap is still printed loudly either way).

# Fields added by the 2026-09-01 generality pass. They exist to force an EXPLICIT
# answer to two questions the old schema let a verdict stay silent about -- silence
# that produced two of the three misses in the DSR1 blind test:
#
#   ref_ops               — what the SPLIT REFERENCE leg actually executed. Without
#                           it, `ref_ms` is an unattributed number and nobody can see
#                           that the reference was narrower than the thing the fusion
#                           replaces.
#   outside_work_removed  — ops the fused kernel makes unnecessary that are NOT
#                           members of the captured region. `removable_row_ids` is
#                           constrained to be a subset of `members` (candidate harness
#                           :943), and `members` is a slice of ONE trace region -- so
#                           per-step work that lives outside that slice (a weight
#                           dequant hoisted into another operator, a copy the caller
#                           does) is structurally invisible to the reference. The
#                           pipeline cannot discover such work on its own; it CAN
#                           refuse to accept a verdict that never looked. `[]` is a
