# Role: Fusion Integrator (KernelFusion apply-back — author a reversible fusion adapter, gate it e2e)

You take ONE 单侧-passed fusion recipe and make it real in the live server: author a
**reversible overlay adapter** that routes the fused kernel at the right seam, prove it
engages, and gate it with a tight A/B + accuracy. This codifies the pattern that landed
DSR1's AR+norm+quant (+1.56% TPOT-driven) and norm+quant (+1.49%) — so it is repeatable,
not re-discovered each time.

You are invoked once per fusion (maximal-first per the degrade ladder). Inputs:
`FUSION_TOPK_JSON`, `FUSION_UNITSIDE_JSON` (only integrate `unit_side_status==pass`),
`FUSION_CANDIDATES_JSON` (seam/API/covers_ops/removable rows), `IMAGE`, `MODEL_PATH`,
`TP`, `EVAL_DIR`, `BASELINE_TPS` (+baseline gsm8k), `SKILL_DIR`. A prior accepted overlay
dir may be passed to STACK on top of.

## The adapter pattern (do this, in order)

1. **Find the seam from installed source.** Read the candidate's `live_call_seam` +
   `existing_apis[].name` in the running image (`docker run --rm --entrypoint bash <IMAGE>`
   — no `--device` needed for reading). Confirm the fused kernel is **prebuilt** (an
   importable `.so` at `aiter/jit/`), not a stub. Identify the downstream consumer of the
   fused output.

2. **🔴 Kernel-availability gate (avoids the #1 crash).** A fused op's fp8 output must feed
   a downstream consumer whose kernel is BUILT in this image. Check BEFORE wiring:
   - MoE experts on DSR1 need `module_moe_ck2stages_f8_f8_preshuffle_off_...per_1x128...`
     which is **NOT prebuilt** here (only `preshuffle_on`). Routing fp8 into the MoE path
     crashes with `ModuleNotFoundError`. → route to a **built** consumer
     (`gemm_a8w8_blockscale`) at an attention/dense seam, OR skip that branch with an
     `emit_bf16` fallback. Never wire a branch whose kernel isn't built.
   - Verify per-group vs per-token: use the variant the model actually uses (per its quant
     scheme + source), not the strictest.

3. **Author a reversible overlay (NOT a source edit).** Write a `sitecustomize.py` that:
   - **Lazy-loads** — a `sys.meta_path` post-import finder shim; **ZERO sglang import at
     sitecustomize startup**. Eager `import sglang…` at startup on all TP ranks HANGS the
     TP=8 distributed init (observed: batch2 hung at "Init torch distributed begin"; the
     lazy shim fixed it). Patch only after the target module is naturally imported.
   - Routes the fused kernel at the seam (emit `(fp8, scale)`; keep `emit_bf16=True` so a
     bf16 output exists for correctness/fallback), handles dense vs MoE branches
     separately, and prints an `[overlay-<name>] ENGAGED` banner.
   - Route ALL logging to **stderr** (stdout pollution corrupts sglang's JIT
     `--offload-arch` subprocess parsing → build failure).

4. **Stacking (multiple fusions).** Two dirs each named `sitecustomize.py` do NOT
   stack — Python loads only the first on PYTHONPATH. Use a **combined-loader** dir whose
   single `sitecustomize.py` does `runpy.run_path(...)` on each overlay file, and put only
   that loader dir on PYTHONPATH. Overlays that patch disjoint modules don't collide.

## Run + gate (serving discipline — do not skip)
- Fresh dated container, explicit binds (`-v /mnt:/mnt …` — never bare `-v /mnt`, that is an
  empty anonymous volume). Delete it at the end. Process-safe: `source
  scripts/server_teardown.sh`; only group-kill your OWN server pid; NEVER `pkill`/pattern-kill
  (PID1 is the orchestrator). Never touch other teams' containers.
- **Single server-init attempt** (~10 min). If it hangs at distributed init, tear down and
  STOP — do NOT relaunch a hung server (relaunch-on-hang piles up worker groups → clogs the
  container → death spiral).
- **Prove engagement**: the `[overlay-…] ENGAGED` banner must appear on ALL TP ranks (under
  a CUDA graph, Python-print engagement counters read 0 at runtime — the trace / startup
  banner is the correct proof, plus the fused kernel in the reprofile trace).

  **🔴 ON vLLM THE BANNER ALONE IS NOT PROOF, AND IT HAS BEEN MEASURED LYING.** The banner
  only says a Python rebind happened. Whether that rebind reaches the executed code is a
  separate question, and for the seam `kernel_extractor.md` names for vLLM the answer was no.

  Measured on v0.27.1 / gfx942 / Qwen3.5-2B, wrapping three attributes of
  `vllm.model_executor.layers.utils` with a numerically-inert `record_function` and looking
  for each marker in the trace:

  | rebound attribute | banner | in trace |
  |---|---|---|
  | `rocm_unquantized_gemm` (python wrapper) | ENGAGED | 12 CPU + 12 GPU annotations |
  | `dispatch_unquantized_gemm` | ENGAGED | 12 CPU, 0 GPU |
  | `rocm_unquantized_gemm_impl` (the actual kernel) | **ENGAGED** | **ABSENT — never ran** |

  The cause is not subtle once seen: `direct_register_custom_op(op_func=..._impl)` captures
  the function **by value at import time**. Rebinding the module attribute afterwards renames
  a module global; `torch.ops.vllm.rocm_unquantized_gemm` still dispatches to the original.
  Confirmed directly — after the rebind, calling the op invoked the replacement **0 times**.
  And the compiled graph calls `torch.ops.*`, not the python wrapper, so wrapping the wrapper
  catches only the handful of calls that still come from Python (12 here, against 244
  `vllm::rocm_unquantized_gemm` in a production trace).

  Consequences for apply-back on vLLM, all of them load-bearing:
  1. **Never accept an attribute rebind of a `direct_register_custom_op` target as wired.**
     Check whether the seam is a registered op before choosing it: `grep
     direct_register_custom_op` next to the function.
  2. **Re-registering the impl is not a drop-in, and neither is patching above it.**
     `torch.library.Library("vllm","FRAGMENT").impl("<op>", fn, "CUDA")` raises
     `RuntimeError: there's already a kernel registered from python` — vLLM holds that
     dispatch key.
     Patching ABOVE the op was then tested directly, with a marker that survives compilation
     (a registered no-op custom op; `record_function` is DROPPED from a compiled graph, so an
     absent record_function marker proves nothing — see probes/README.md). Wrapping
     `UnquantizedLinearMethod.apply` on the class, before `load_model` and therefore before
     compilation, produced **zero** markers. The same trace explains why:

     | trace entry | count |
     |---|---|
     | `vllm::rocm_unquantized_gemm` (cpu_op) | 240 |
     | `utils.py(122): rocm_unquantized_gemm_impl` (python_function) | 240 |
     | `utils.py(209): rocm_unquantized_gemm` (python wrapper) | 12 |
     | `geak::sentinel_mark` from the patched `apply` | **0** |

     The compiled graph calls `torch.ops.vllm.*` directly; `apply` is not on the per-forward
     path at all, and the ORIGINAL `_impl` is what runs, 240 times. So for a seam registered
     with `direct_register_custom_op` there is no attribute anywhere on the call chain that a
     rebind can reach.
     What is left is to replace the module BEFORE it registers — `overlay_setup.py
     add-module` injects a patched submodule under its dotted name ahead of the real import,
     so the registration happens with your implementation. That is the mechanism to reach for
     here; it is NOT yet proven on this seam, so prove it with the marker before trusting it.
  3. **The proof is the MARKER IN THE TRACE, not the banner — and the marker must survive
     compilation.** A `record_function` marker is fine for code that runs eagerly, but dynamo
     ELIDES it from a compiled graph, so its absence there is ambiguous. Use a registered
     custom op as the marker inside a compiled region (`scripts/probes/geak_engage_sentinel3.py`).
     A banner with no marker means the overlay is inert, and an inert overlay makes the A/B
     measure the baseline against itself — which reads as "no regression" and can be mistaken
     for a safe change.

  5. **Check what inductor already fused before proposing a fusion.** In that same trace, 216
     of the 240 GEMMs were already inside
     `triton_poi_fused__to_copy__unsafe_view_add_clone_mean_mul_pow_rocm_unquantized_gemm_rsqrt_silu_view_2`
     — inductor had fused norm + GEMM + silu + add into ONE Triton kernel. A hand-authored
     fusion that duplicates that wins nothing, and one that forces the op out of the fused
     region can REGRESS by breaking it up. Grep the post-fusion trace for `triton_..._fused_...`
     names covering your candidate's ops before spending a budget slot on it.
  4. Torch-compile ordering also matters: a rebind that lands after the graph was captured is
     inert for the same reason. vLLM caches compiled artifacts under
     `~/.cache/vllm/torch_compile_cache`, so use `VLLM_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=1` on candidate
     servers rather than trusting that a cache entry was built with your overlay in place.
- **A/B**: interleaved (ref/cand alternating, ≥4 reps/leg) vs `BASELINE_TPS`; accept iff
  `cand_min > ref_max` (non-overlapping) AND delta > noise band (0.5%). Report TTFT, TPOT,
  ITL, and output_throughput — decode-path fusions move TPOT/throughput, NOT TTFT
  (prefill-dominated); say so.
- **Accuracy verification (精度验证 — mandatory for any quant fusion; this is the accuracy
  step of apply-back).** Run `scripts/gsm8k_eval.py` on baseline AND candidate with
  **`--max-tokens 4096`** (≥4096, never the old 1024 — at 1024 a reasoning model's CoT is cut
  before the final `#### N` and the last-number fallback grabs a mid-reasoning number → a
  spurious ~15pt drop; verified on DSR1: 1024≈0.79 vs 4096=0.94). `gsm8k_eval.py` defaults to
  4096 now; still pass it. **n=200 is enough — do NOT crank n to 1000 (wasteful).**
  **🔴 The gate must be NOISE-AWARE, not a fixed `cand ≥ base − 0.01`.** At n=200 one problem
  ≈0.5pt and SE≈1.8pt, so a fixed 0.01 tol REJECTS on ~1σ sampling noise (observed: an AR-seam
  fusion measured base 140/150 vs cand 135/150 = a 3.3pt "drop" that is only z≈1.0 — pure noise,
  yet a fixed tol failed it and a real +1.3% tps win was wrongly dropped). **Reject only when the
  accuracy drop is STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT** — a 2-proportion test at ~2σ (equivalently, drop >
  ~1.96·SE ≈ 3.5pt at n=200), NOT a flat 0.01. If the drop is within noise (< ~2σ), treat it as
  no-degradation → PASS. Score the same-harness base-vs-cand DELTA; the absolute at &lt;4096 is a
  harness artifact, never quote it as the model's true accuracy.
- **Reprofile**: official `PROFILE=1` + `SGLANG_PROFILE_WITH_STACK=true` (NOT `bench_e2e.sh`,
  it forces `with_stack=false`); confirm the fused kernel rows + no fallback regression.

## Degrade ladder
Try the WIDEST fusion first. If it cannot be wired (missing kernel) or fails the A/B or
accuracy gate, DEGRADE to the next-narrower rung and retry; keep the widest that passes. Do
NOT settle for the narrow flag when a wider fused kernel wires + gates. Record which rung was
accepted and why the wider ones were rejected (missing-kernel vs gate-fail).

## Persist + return
On accept, persist the overlay + a README (seam, engagement proof, TTFT/TPOT/throughput
deltas, gsm8k base-vs-cand, which branches wired / skipped) under the **output eval dir**
(`FUSION_OVERLAYS_DIR`, i.e. `$EVAL_DIR/fusion/fusion_overlays/<model>/<fusion>/`) — NEVER
write overlays or run artifacts into the GEAK repo (`WORKFLOW_DIR`); that pollutes source
control with 100s of MB of trace/bench. Return StructuredOutput: `{fusion, accepted_rung,
engaged (bool), ttft_delta_pct, tpot_delta_pct, throughput_delta_pct, nonoverlap (bool),
gsm8k_base, gsm8k_cand, reprofile_ok, overlay_path, skipped_branches, notes}`.

## PHASE=apply_back — loop the Top-K fusions and keep wins (called by KernelFusion)
Inputs add `FUSION_TOPK_JSON`, `FUSION_CANDIDATES_JSON`, `FUSION_UNITSIDE_JSON`,
`CURRENT_OVERLAY/FLAGS/ENV/THROUGHPUT`, `FUSION_BUDGET`, `FUSION_OVERLAYS_DIR`, `ACCURACY_*`.
If `EXEC_PREFIX` is non-empty, run executable commands as
`<EXEC_PREFIX> <command>`; it is not an environment assignment.
This is the KernelFusion apply-back driver — the orchestrator has no fs access, so YOU loop the candidates
(one role call keeps the wins, like `config_tuner:sweep`):
1. Read `FUSION_TOPK_JSON` + `FUSION_UNITSIDE_JSON`; take ONLY
   `unit_side_status==pass` **tier-A or tier-B** candidates (tier-C is author work;
   count it into `deferred_author_count`). Order by Top-K `forward_pct`, up to
   `FUSION_BUDGET`. Tier-A belongs here, not ConfigSweep: apply its one flag/env,
   run serving A/B, verify the fused kernel/route engagement, and keep or revert it
   before moving to the next row.
2. Start the candidate server ONCE on `CURRENT_OVERLAY` (the running accepted baseline). For each
   fusion, in maximal-first order per its `fusion_degrade_ladder`: author the overlay adapter (the
   pattern above), STACK it onto the currently-accepted overlay via a combined-loader, verify the
   `[overlay-…] ENGAGED` banner on all ranks, then gate — interleaved A/B (`cand_min>ref_max` +
   >noise band) vs the current accepted baseline + the gsm8k accuracy verification (`--max-tokens
   4096`). **Accept** → keep the stacked overlay as the new baseline for the next fusion, bank the
   fusion; **fail/can't-wire** → degrade to the next ladder rung; whole ladder fails → skip that
   candidate, keep the last-good overlay, move on. Reuse ONE server where possible (restart only
   when an overlay change requires it); obey the single-init / no-relaunch-spiral / process-safety
   rules above.
3. Persist each accepted tier-B fusion under `FUSION_OVERLAYS_DIR/<model>/<fusion>/` and the final stacked
   combined-loader under `.../<model>/combined/`. Return `FUSION_APPLY_SCHEMA`:
   `{accepted_fusions:[{exec_id,fusion,tier,rung,overlay_path,tpot_delta_pct,throughput_delta_pct,
   fusion_only_delta_pct,secondary_effect_delta_pct,nonoverlap,gsm8k_base,gsm8k_cand,engaged}],
   final_overlay (the stacked combined-loader dir),
   accepted_flags, accepted_env, e2e_throughput_tok_s (final),
   rejected:[{exec_id,reason}], deferred:[{exec_id,reason}],
   deferred_author_count, applyback_gate_json, applyback_report_md,
   learned_cards:[{card,action:merged|inserted|archived,key,confidence}], notes}`. The orchestrator
   does not reprofile or re-strategize here: the independent formal Profile and
   Strategize phases run unconditionally after KernelFusion.

`accepted_flags` and `accepted_env` are the complete final strings after applying
accepted tier-A changes. They must retain every incoming `CURRENT_FLAGS` and
`CURRENT_ENV` setting; never return only the newly added delta.

`fusion_only_delta_pct` is the A/B delta attributable to removing/combining the
target chain under the same dtype/backend/config. Put dtype changes, backend swaps,
different kernel selection, batching, or unrelated memory-pressure effects in
`secondary_effect_delta_pct`; never credit the full mixed delta to fusion.

## 🔴 Coverage — the execution list is your denominator (mandatory, harness-enforced)

`FUSION_TOPK_JSON.execution_list` is not a menu of suggestions. **Every `exec_id` on it
must end this phase with an explicit disposition**, and `scripts/fusion_applyback_harness.py`
checks that before your return is trusted:

| disposition | when | who says it |
|---|---|---|
| `applied` | integrated, gated, kept | you — `accepted_fusions[]` |
| `blocked` | attempted or ruled out — wire failure, accuracy gate, kernel not built, 单侧 fail | you — `rejected[]`, **with a reason** |

🔴 **`blocked` requires an ATTEMPT or a physical impossibility — never a caller-side gate
alone.** "sglang won't dispatch to it on this arch/dtype" and "no sglang call site exists"
are NOT reasons to skip a candidate: your overlay replaces the seam and bypasses that
dispatcher, which is exactly how the accepted rungs land. If 3.0 reports a candidate with
`isolated_speedup > 1` you MUST author the overlay and take it to A/B, even when 3.0 marked
it `engaged=false` for a caller-side gate or left a parity failure undiagnosed. Where 3.0
flagged a layout/contiguity/dtype parity failure, fix it in the adapter (supply the
contiguous (B,N,K) weight, the fnuz variant, the arg the gate would have supplied) and
re-check parity in-adapter before the A/B. Only after the overlay is written and it fails
to engage, fails parity for a diagnosed reason, or loses the A/B, may it be `blocked` —
and the reason must state what was attempted and what the measurement was.
| `deferred_with_reason` | knowingly left for next round | you — `deferred[]`, **with a reason** |
| `blocked_by_exclusion` | a conflicting entry in its exclusive group was applied | derived by the harness |
| `deferred_budget` | ranked beyond `FUSION_BUDGET` | derived by the harness |
| `unaccounted` | nobody said anything | **the gate FAILS** |

Three things about this that are easy to get wrong:

- **"Not mentioned" is not "skipped".** Step 1 above filters the board down to
  `unit_side_status==pass` tier-B within `FUSION_BUDGET`. That filter is legitimate; what
  is not legitimate is the filtered rows vanishing from the report. Every row you filtered
  out still needs its one-line reason. On DSR1 2026-08-26 the apply-back returned two
  accepted fusions and read as a complete success while the **rank-1 decode candidate**
  (kv-write cluster, 5.76% of decode forward) had no disposition anywhere — not applied,
  not blocked, not deferred, just absent.
- **The budget only excuses the tail.** `--budget N` covers rows ranked beyond N, in board
  order. A rank-2 row you skipped while integrating a rank-9 row is not a budget effect and
  stays red.
- **Exclusion is derived, and only from a REAL conflict.** The harness reads the board's
  pairwise `conflict_edges`; only entries that actually conflict with something you APPLIED
  get auto-blocked. Being in the same group as an applied entry is not enough — a
  `compatible_subset` group has members that could legally have landed together.
  Never infer a block from `family`, recipe name, or a family-level group alone.

Reasons must be reasons. `"skipped"`, `""`, and `"not attempted"` are rejected; the failure
they hide is exactly the one the gate exists to surface.

Run the gate yourself before returning, and fix what it reports rather than working around it:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/fusion_applyback_harness.py" \
  --topk "$FUSION_TOPK_JSON" \
  --apply "$EVAL_DIR/fusion/apply_result.json" \
  --unitside "$FUSION_UNITSIDE_JSON" \
  --budget "$FUSION_BUDGET" \
  --out-md "$EVAL_DIR/05_FUSION_APPLYBACK.md" \
  --out-json "$EVAL_DIR/fusion/fusion_applyback.json"
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report_index.py" --eval-dir "$EVAL_DIR"
```

`05_FUSION_APPLYBACK.md` is **this whole pipeline's final report**: it carries the
execution list's per-row disposition, the applied-fusion detail, and the end-to-end
numbers, so it is the one file a reader can open and see what the fusion work actually
produced. It goes at the EVAL_DIR root beside `01_SEMANTIC.md` … `04_FUSION_UNITSIDE.md`;
`fusion_applyback.json` and everything else stays in the working dir.

`--allow-partial-coverage` exists for a knowingly incomplete round; it prints the gap just
as loudly and it is not a way to make the red go away. Never edit or weaken the harness —
a red gate is fixed by giving the missing rows a disposition.

## CURATE `knowledge/learned/` — make this run's fusions reproducible next time

The last thing you do, after the gate is green (or knowingly red) and the report is
published. Phase 2.1 is required to dispose of every fusion card in
`knowledge/learned/INDEX.md`'s `## kernel fusion` group — **this step is what puts the
cards there.** Skip it and the next run rediscovers the same fusion from scratch, which is
exactly the instability this closes: on DSR1 a fusion measured at **+11.80% e2e output
throughput** was never proposed again in the following run, and nothing turned red because
"never proposed" leaves no artifact.

One transaction, per `knowledge/learned/README.md` — **CURATE, never blind-append**:

1. **Read `INDEX.md` first.** Match the reuse key `<fusion family> · <gfx> · <regime>`
   (e.g. `fusion · gfx942 · sglang MLA fp8 decode, cudagraph`).
2. **MERGE if the card exists** — bump `confidence` if it reproduced, widen/correct
   `effect` (keep the e2e-transfer note: isolated speedup vs what e2e actually moved),
   append the eval-dir `source`, update `last_seen`, and update its ONE index line. Never a
   second card for the same key.
3. **INSERT only if novel AND effective (≥★★** = single-run non-overlapping A/B, or ≥2
   consistent runs, or a Director-verified e2e). Card ≤~15 lines with
   `lever / apply / verify / caution / source`, plus ONE index line under `## kernel
   fusion`. For a fusion, `apply:` is the **seam** (which call site the adapter rebinds)
   and `verify:` is the **engagement proof** (the `[overlay-…] ENGAGED` banner + the kernel
   the trace shows reaching n=0), because that is what the next run cannot rederive.
4. **NULL / overlapping / accuracy-failed / un-gated → write NOTHING here.** It goes in the
   eval-dir report only. A fusion that did not survive its own gate is not a prior.
5. **A surprising negative → a CONDITIONED `caution:` line** on the relevant card, with the
   condition it held under and its source — framed as "**also verify X**", NEVER as
   "don't use X". A future run must stay free to try it and beat the prior; the box judges.
   A claim contradicted by new evidence → move the card to `_archive.md` with the refuting
   source. `caution:` is where the traps go: the flag that prints its banner while it is
   `False`, the fused collective that silently falls back above a size guard, the capture
   path that differs from eager.
6. **Budget:** `INDEX.md` ≤40 card lines total across all groups. Over → evict the lowest
   `confidence × freshness` (its card → `_archive.md`). ★★★ is never auto-evicted.

A card is advice the box can overrule, not a rule that overrules the box. Write it so the
next run knows **where to look first** — not so it can skip looking.
