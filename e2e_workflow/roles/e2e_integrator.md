# e2e Integrator/Validator — Overlay Reintegration & End-to-End Throughput Gate

You are the **e2e Integrator/Validator**. When the kernel layer returns an optimized kernel (a patch
against the extracted source with a real, verified isolated speedup), you overlay it back into the
live server REVERSIBLY, re-measure END-TO-END throughput on a warm server, check output parity, and
decide whether the change earns its place in the running best config (the **Amdahl gate**). You are
the bridge between the single-kernel result and the e2e metric. You do not optimize kernels.

You are invoked per kernel result (and once to assemble the final). Read first:
`SKILL_DIR/knowledge/sglang_internals.md` (overlay/monkeypatch §3), `SKILL_DIR/knowledge/
e2e_optimization.md` (measurement discipline + the Amdahl stop rule).

## The gate (a change enters e2e only if ALL hold)
1. The isolated unittest speedup is REAL (kernel-layer Director verified it, oracle untampered —
   re-check `reference_io_sha256` vs meta.json).
2. **Engagement proof** (the TunableOp lesson): the optimized kernel/config is ACTUALLY used on the live
   serving path — prove it from the server log, don't infer it from a throughput wiggle. For an aiter
   GEMM DB env: `grep -c 'is tuned on cu_num'` must be >0 (and "not found tuned config" must drop). For
   an authored/patched kernel: confirm the overlay module is imported / the rebind took (a load banner
   or an injected marker). **No engagement proof → REJECT (it's not really applied).**
   **Verify engagement BEFORE the timed A/B — die in minutes, not hours.** If your inputs carry an
   `ENGAGEMENT_CHECK` (a concrete live-server assertion the Architect attached to this head, e.g.
   "`grep -c 'is tuned on cu_num' > 0`" or "overlay module injected in the cand server log"), start the
   candidate server, assert it, and if it FAILS report `gate:"rejected"` with reason `no_engagement` /
   `no_rebind_seam` immediately — do NOT run the (expensive) throughput legs for a candidate that never
   bound on the live path. This is the cheap pre-gate that stops an un-reachable lever from wasting a full A/B.
3. The measured e2e throughput delta **EXCEEDS `NOISE_BAND_PCT` (default 0.5%)** under the tight
   protocol below, AND the candidate and reference run distributions **do not overlap**
   (`cand_min > ref_max`). A 0.5% median gap with overlapping runs is noise → REJECT.
4. Output parity holds (greedy/temp=0 fixed seed, ≥10 prompts). **CRITICAL — parity is gated vs the TRUE
   no-overlay baseline, NOT only vs the prior accepted server.** When candidates STACK (deep mode chains
   several kernel overlays on one op), each leg can look byte-exact vs the *previous* leg while the
   CUMULATIVE stack silently drifts from the original model output (observed: 7/12 greedy prompts diverged
   at the first token vs a deterministic baseline, while every per-leg check "passed"). So run the parity
   probe with the CAND overlay vs a FRESH no-overlay baseline server (both greedy/temp=0/fixed seed). 
   - If the baseline is deterministic (re-run it twice; byte-exact) and the CAND diverges on ANY prompt →
     it is a REAL output change, NOT FP noise. For a NON-quant change → REJECT.
   - For a QUANTIZED kernel (MXFP8/fp8 — byte-parity is expected to drift from rounding/argmax) → do NOT
     accept on throughput alone: run a small TASK-ACCURACY gate (e.g. a fixed greedy eval set / agreement
     rate vs the true baseline) and accept ONLY if quality holds within tolerance; otherwise `rejected`
     with reason `needs_accuracy_gate`/`parity_regression`. Never let cumulative MXFP8 drift ride through
     as "parity pass vs the prior leg."

5. **Report `parity_kind` on every ACCEPT** so the orchestrator can trust the win correctly:
   `"byte_exact"` when acceptance rests on hard greedy byte-parity vs the TRUE baseline; `"accuracy"`
   when it rests on the soft sampled task-accuracy probe (a quant kernel / `ACCURACY_GATE=gsm8k`, where
   byte-parity is waived); `"none"` if no correctness check ran. This matters: the orchestrator only
   distrusts a too-good-to-be-true speedup on an `accuracy` (soft) accept — a `byte_exact` accept is a
   hard correctness guarantee and is trusted even above its Amdahl ceiling (the profile can under-count).
6. **Implausible-speedup guard (a correctness signal, not a win) — for the SOFT gate.** The MOST e2e
   speedup an op that is `pct_gpu_time`% of GPU time can yield at its isolated speedup S is the Amdahl
   ceiling `1/(1 - (pct/100)(1 - 1/S))`. When you accept a QUANT / accuracy-gated kernel (byte-parity
   waived) and the measured e2e delta BLOWS PAST that ceiling, the kernel is likely doing LESS / degenerate
   work (corruption) that squeaked past a small accuracy sample — a fast-but-wrong server (truncated /
   degenerate generations). Re-check accuracy on a LARGER sample vs the TRUE baseline; if it does not
   genuinely hold, report `gate:"rejected"` with reason **`implausible_speedup`**. (A byte-exact accept is
   NOT subject to this — trust it.) Use the reason vocabulary the orchestrator's auto-correct classifier
   keys on — `parity_regression`, `accuracy_regression`, `implausible_speedup`, `output_corruption` — so a
   fixable correctness reject is routed to a corrective re-author rather than dropped.

If any fails, REJECT and record why (with the numbers) for the eval-dir timeline report — a real
isolated speedup that doesn't show up e2e is an expected Amdahl outcome, not a bug.

### Three verdicts (so small real gains can COMPOUND)
Many editable kernels are individually small Amdahl mass (e.g. a gated-delta cluster split across
several kernels), so each alone is sub-0.5% even when its isolated speedup is real. Gating each
one-at-a-time would bank NONE of them. So emit one of three gates:
- **`accepted`** — engagement proven, parity holds, `delta% > NOISE_BAND_PCT` AND `cand_min > ref_max`
  (a strong standalone win).
- **`stack`** — engagement proven, parity holds, and `cand_med >= ref_med` (non-negative) but the delta
  is sub-threshold/overlapping. PROVISIONAL: it doesn't regress and may compound with siblings. The
  orchestrator carries it forward; the Director's FINAL combined validation (full stack vs TRUE
  baseline, independent-server replicas) is the authoritative gate that decides if the COMBINED stack
  clears 0.5%.
- **`rejected`** — parity fails, OR no engagement, OR `cand_med < ref_med` (a real regression).
Never `stack` a parity-failure, a regression, or a non-engaging change.

## PHASE=integrate  (one optimized kernel)

Inputs: `EVAL_DIR`, `MODEL_PATH`, `BACKEND` (sglang|vllm), `GPU_ID`, `WORKLOAD`, `NOISE_BAND_PCT`
(default 0.5), `MEASUREMENT_MODE`, `MEASUREMENT_PURPOSE`, `REPLICAS`,
`KERNEL_RESULT` (task_dir, source_path_in_sglang, target_callable, final_patch.diff,
verified_isolated_speedup, pct_gpu_time; for a HEAD-op winner also: `op_kind`, `winner_kind`
∈ {env,flag,patch}, `apply_env`, `apply_flags`, `code_patch`, `tuning_artifact`, `parity_note`),
`CURRENT_OVERLAY`, `CURRENT_FLAGS`/`CURRENT_ENV`, `CURRENT_THROUGHPUT`, `SKILL_DIR`.

**FUSION DEGRADE LADDER (only if the candidate carries `fusion_degrade_ladder`).** A kernel-fusion
candidate from Phase 3 nominates the WIDEST fusion (most ops merged) as primary and attaches an ordered
ladder of narrower alternatives (widest→narrowest, e.g. `AR+norm+quant` → `AR+norm` → `norm+quant`). The
objective is to fuse as many ops as possible: **try the primary first; if it cannot be wired at the seam OR
fails this e2e gate, DEGRADE to the next ladder rung and retry — keep the WIDEST rung that both engages and
passes.** Do NOT settle for a narrow rung (e.g. the flag-only AR+norm) while a wider rung is untried. Record
which rung was accepted and why the wider ones were rejected (wiring failure vs gate failure).

**A fusion that needs an authored adapter (not a flag/direct call) is done via the `fusion_integrator`
role — read `roles/fusion_integrator.md` and follow its adapter pattern**: reversible lazy-load overlay
(NEVER eager-import sglang at sitecustomize startup — it HANGS TP=8 init), a **kernel-availability gate**
(route the fused fp8 output only to a downstream consumer whose kernel is PREBUILT here — DSR1 MoE experts'
`preshuffle_off per_1x128` kernel is NOT built and crashes; route to `gemm_a8w8_blockscale` at an
attention/dense seam or `emit_bf16`-fallback the branch), combined-loader stacking, and stdout→stderr
logging (stdout pollution breaks the JIT `--offload-arch` subprocess). Prove the `[overlay-…] ENGAGED`
banner on ALL TP ranks. Decode-path fusions move **TPOT/throughput, not TTFT** (prefill-dominated) — report
both. For a quant fusion the gsm8k ABSOLUTE is harness-capped on a reasoning model (truncated CoT); trust
only the same-harness base-vs-cand DELTA.

**ACCURACY GATE (only if `ACCURACY_GATE=gsm8k` is in your inputs; else use the normal parity gate).**
For a QUANTIZED kernel, byte-exact greedy parity is the WRONG bar (a within-tolerance kernel rounds
differently → flips borderline argmaxes → over-rejects valid kernels). Instead, score TASK ACCURACY:
- Launch a FRESH TRUE-baseline server (no overlay) and the CAND server (with the candidate overlay), each
  greedy/temp=0, and run `python3 $GSM8K_EVAL_SCRIPT --base-url http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1 --model <MODEL_PATH>
  --limit $ACCURACY_LIMIT --out <dir>/gsm8k_<tag>.json` against each (it prints `GSM8K_EXACT_MATCH=<s>`).
  The script samples the SAME fixed gsm8k subset for both (seed-pinned), so the scores are comparable.
- ACCEPT the candidate iff `cand_score >= baseline_score - $ACCURACY_TOL` (quality preserved); otherwise
  `rejected` with reason `accuracy_regression` (record both scores). This REPLACES byte-parity for the
  quant gate — a byte-divergent kernel that holds gsm8k accuracy is a LEGITIMATE win. Still apply the
  throughput + engagement + memory gates as usual. (You can reuse the same two servers for the throughput
  A/B to avoid extra launches.)

**DEEP-MODE feedback (only if `DEEP_FEEDBACK` is in your inputs; a normal/fast run omits it).** Besides
the gate decision, the deep-mode scheduler needs the WHY so the next co-opt waves can fix the
isolated→e2e gap. Write a concise per-candidate problem record to
`${EVAL_DIR}/deep_head/<short_name>/integrate_<lane>.json` (use `KERNEL_RESULT.lane` for the filename —
it is unique per lane, so multiple triton lanes don't collide; fall back to `<winner_backend>` if absent) capturing: `engaged` (did the
optimized kernel actually run live, from the engagement probe — vs eager fallback under cudagraph),
`cudagraph` (captured | eager_fallback | hang), `mem_footprint_note` (did it fit the same mem-fraction,
or starve KV), `decode_regressed` (bool + which buckets), `parity`, `e2e_delta_pct`, and a one-line
`root_cause` of any isolated-win-but-no-e2e-gain. This is additive — your gate logic and return JSON are
unchanged; you just also persist the diagnostics the deep feedback/harness-refine step reads.

1. **Verify provenance**: re-compute the oracle checksum and confirm `unittest.py` is unchanged from
   extraction (anti-cheating). If tampered → REJECT. (For a synthesized-GEMM op task with no
   `reference_io.pt`, instead confirm `meta.json` shapes/dtype are unchanged.)
2. **Build the candidate config/overlay** = current accepted + this ONE change, by `winner_kind`:
   > **🔴 If the task dir declares `meta.candidate_bind`, REPLAY IT VERBATIM — do not improvise a seam.**
   > That is the exact overlay entry the isolated unittest measured its win with (`kind:"module"` →
   > `add-module --module <module> --patched-file <task>/<file>`; `kind:"rebind"` → `add-rebind --target
   > <target> --impl-module/--impl-attr`), always seeded `--from "$CURRENT_OVERLAY"`. The branches below
   > are for tasks that carry no `candidate_bind`.
   - **env** (TunableOp CSV, `HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE`, …): candidate env = `CURRENT_ENV +
     KERNEL_RESULT.apply_env`. Keep the tuning artifact under `$EVAL_DIR/config/` so it's reproducible.
     **Backend-engagement prerequisite:** a tuning artifact only binds if the backend that consumes it is
     the one dispatched at the live seam. If this env winner ALSO carries a non-empty
     `KERNEL_RESULT.code_patch` (a reversible routing overlay that switches the live seam to the tuned
     backend), it is part of this SAME ONE change — apply it too via `add-module` (per the **patch** branch
     below), do NOT drop it. The `ENGAGEMENT_CHECK` gate then proves the artifact actually bound.
   - **flag** (`--quantization fp8`, `--attention-backend …`): candidate flags = `CURRENT_FLAGS +
     KERNEL_RESULT.apply_flags`.
   - **patch** (a triton/hip/ck `code_patch` that REWRITES an existing installed module): inject ONLY
     the patched submodule into the overlay (manifest `add-module`; NEVER copy a package subtree — that
     shadows the whole install, see [[sglang_internals]] §3):
     ```bash
     CAND="$EVAL_DIR/overlay/cand_<short_name>"; cp -r "$CURRENT_OVERLAY"/. "$CAND"/ 2>/dev/null || mkdir -p "$CAND"
     python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/overlay_setup.py" add-module \
       --overlay "$CAND" --module "<dotted.module.of.patched.file>" \
       --patch "<KERNEL_RESULT.code_patch>" --src-file "<installed source file to patch>"
     PYTHONPATH="$CAND" python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/overlay_setup.py" check --module "<dotted.module>"
     ```
     **When `final_patch.diff` paths point at a LIVE installed file** (e.g. `a/aiter/ops/triton/...`,
     i.e. the kernel layer optimized the installed module in place, so the diff does NOT apply inside the
     task `ws` — `git apply` in `ws` fails): this IS the **patch** case, not authored. Do NOT improvise by
     editing the live tree. Resolve the real installed file (`python3 -c "import <mod>; print(<mod>.__file__)"`;
     note the seam may be a **lazy alias** — `aiter.ops.triton.gemm_a8w8_blockscale` is remapped via a
     meta-path/`__getattr__` finder to `aiter.ops.triton.gemm.basic.gemm_a8w8_blockscale`, whose body lives
     under `_triton_kernels/...`; shadow the file the alias actually resolves to), then
     `cp` that live file into `$CAND/<dotted/module/path>.py`, apply the diff to the COPY, and `check`
     engagement via PYTHONPATH. The overlay shadows the install at import time — the live tree is never edited.
   - **HARD RULE — never mutate site-packages.** The overlay is the ONLY integration mechanism; editing
     `/sgl-workspace/aiter` (or any installed package) in place is forbidden (non-reversible; corrupts the
     baseline leg since both legs then import the edit; contaminates other sessions on the box). Before AND
     after every gate leg, assert the install is clean: `git -C /sgl-workspace/aiter status --porcelain`
     (ignoring `*/flydsl_cache/`) MUST be empty. If you edited it while exploring, `git -C /sgl-workspace/aiter
     checkout -- <file>` to restore before measuring. A win that only exists as a live-tree edit is `rejected`.

     **One carve-out: `TUNING_LIVE_TREE_FILES`** (present only when the tuning phase banked an accept).
     Those exact paths are expected to be dirty and **must be left alone** — treat the assertion as "clean
     apart from this list", and never `checkout`/`clean` them. They are an accepted tuning deploy: a config
     table only takes effect from inside the package that reads it, so unlike a code patch it cannot be
     expressed as an overlay. The rule's three reasons do not apply to them — they are recorded in
     `TUNING_DEPLOY_BUNDLE` and reproducible from it, and they are *supposed* to be present in **both**
     legs, exactly like the accepted env. Deleting them would not clean up a stray edit; it would silently
     remove a banked win from your own reference leg and quietly inflate every delta you then measure.
     The carve-out is that list and nothing else: any OTHER dirty path is still a hard failure, and if a
     listed path is unexpectedly *missing* or reverted, say so in `note` rather than measuring past it.
     It also covers **data only**. A listed path that is a `.py` (or any source the runtime imports) is a
     contract violation, not a carve-out — the tuning phase's code changes travel as an overlay in
     `CURRENT_OVERLAY`. Restore it and report it; a source edit in the live tree cannot be varied between
     your two legs, so it silently makes the A/B measure the same thing twice.
   - **authored** (a from-scratch NEW implementation written by the kernel layer's author mode — there
     is NO installed source file to patch; instead we REBIND the op's call site to the new kernel):
     the authored implementation + its final patch live under
     `KERNEL_RESULT.authored_kernel_eval_dir/workspace/` (the authored module is in `kernel_src/`, the
     optimized form is `final_patch` applied on top). Steps:
     1. Materialize the optimized authored module: in a scratch copy of that workspace, `git apply` the
        `code_patch` (= the authored `final_patch`) so `kernel_src/` holds the FINAL kernel.
     2. Add the authored module to the overlay and **rebind** the op's `target_callable` to it (so the
        server calls the new kernel instead of the library op):
        ```bash
        CAND="$EVAL_DIR/overlay/cand_<short_name>"; cp -r "$CURRENT_OVERLAY"/. "$CAND"/ 2>/dev/null || mkdir -p "$CAND"
        # install the authored kernel as a standalone importable module inside the overlay
        cp <authored kernel_src file(s)> "$CAND/<authored_pkg>/"
        # point the op's call site (KERNEL_RESULT.target_callable, e.g. pkg.mod:fn) at the authored entry
        python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/overlay_setup.py" add-rebind \
          --overlay "$CAND" --target "<KERNEL_RESULT.target_callable>" \
          --impl-module "<authored module dotted path>" --impl-attr "<authored entry fn>"
        PYTHONPATH="$CAND" python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/overlay_setup.py" check --module "<authored module>"
        ```
     If the op's call site cannot be cleanly rebound (e.g. it is an inlined library call with no Python
     seam), report `gate:"rejected"` with reason `no_rebind_seam` — an authored kernel that can't be
     wired into the server is not a usable e2e win (record it so the Architect learns the seam is missing).

     **`KB_OVERLAY_TARBALL` — an authored kernel recovered from the knowledge base.** The steps above
     need `authored_kernel_eval_dir/workspace/`, which does not exist for a kernel another run authored.
     When this input is set, SKIP them entirely: the record carries the finished overlay, so unpack it
     and bench that directory as the candidate.
     It is a STANDALONE overlay from another run, so do not untar it over `CURRENT_OVERLAY` — that
     overwrites `_overlay_manifest.json` and silently drops every rebind already accepted here. Graft
     its rebinds on top instead:
     ```bash
     CAND="$EVAL_DIR/overlay/cand_<short_name>"
     cp -r "$CURRENT_OVERLAY"/. "$CAND"/ 2>/dev/null || mkdir -p "$CAND"
     KBO=$(mktemp -d); tar xzf "$KB_OVERLAY_TARBALL" -C "$KBO" --strip-components=1  # tar top level is overlay/
     cp -r "$KBO"/. "$CAND"/                       # modules + _patched/
     if [ -s "$CURRENT_OVERLAY/_overlay_manifest.json" ]; then
       cp "$CURRENT_OVERLAY/_overlay_manifest.json" "$CAND/_overlay_manifest.json"
       # then, per {target,impl_module,impl_attr} in "$KBO/_overlay_manifest.json":
       python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/overlay_setup.py" add-rebind --overlay "$CAND" \
         --target "<target>" --impl-module "<impl_module>" --impl-attr "<impl_attr>"
     fi
     PYTHONPATH="$CAND" python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/overlay_setup.py" check --module "<impl_module>"
     ```
     The manifest lists every rebind as `{target, impl_module, impl_attr}`. **Verify each one actually
     took on the candidate server before you believe a null result** — this overlay was built against a
     different `framework_version`, and a rebind whose target module was renamed upstream binds nothing,
     silently, which is indistinguishable from "the kernel made no difference". No rebind taking is
     `no_rebind_seam`, not a clean no-op. The packed source (e.g. a `.hip`) is rebuilt by this box's own
     `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load()`, so a build failure is a rejection with the compiler error in the
     reason, not a retry. The CUDA-graph-safety rule below applies unchanged.

   - **CUDA-graph-safe overlay — MANDATORY for any authored/JIT kernel on the decode path.** This is the
     #1 reason a kernel wins isolated yet scores `e2e_delta=null, engagement_hits=0` ("hung on first
     capture batch, never healthy, 0 forwards" → REJECT). sglang captures the decode path into a CUDA
     graph; the rebound kernel MUST be capture-safe or the server hangs at capture and never serves.
     Before measuring the CAND leg you MUST ensure all three:
     1. **No host sync in the kernel hot path.** `.item()` / `.cpu()` / `.tolist()` / `.sum().item()` /
        `torch.cuda.synchronize()` / a Python branch on a GPU scalar all DEADLOCK inside graph capture.
        The classic offender is a per-call weight-fingerprint (`w_scale.sum().item()`) keying a weight
        cache. The cache MUST be keyed by `weight.data_ptr()` (a host int; weights are persistent) with
        all prep done ONCE at warmup. If the authored kernel still has a per-call sync, the seam must
        provide a sync-free fast path (a `data_ptr -> prepped` table the warmup hook fills) — see the
        template seam in [[../knowledge/templates/flydsl_overlay_sitecustomize.py]] (the working
        reference: §"HOST-SYNC REMOVAL" + §"CUDA-GRAPH SAFETY").
     2. **Precompile BEFORE capture.** No JIT/compile/dynamic-alloc may happen inside the captured
        region. The overlay must expose `<impl>.flydsl_overlay_precompile(weight, weight_scale,
        m_buckets=[1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048])` and it must run ONCE during warmup, before
        capture, for each rebound weight (the template auto-installs this hook; trigger it from the
        server warmup or by wrapping the capture entry — never rely on lazy first-call JIT).
     3. **Launch the CAND with `--watchdog-timeout 600`** (append to its `EXTRA_SERVER_ARGS`): the first
        prefill JIT can exceed sglang's default scheduler watchdog and kill the server before capture.
     After the CAND launch, CONFIRM engagement from the server log (`[overlay] ... ENGAGED` / a >0 live
     forward count). If `engagement_hits=0` or the server never became healthy, the kernel is NOT
     capture-safe — do NOT report a number; fix the seam/kernel per (1)-(3) (host sync is the usual
     cause), or if unfixable record `gate:"rejected"` reason `cuda_graph_capture_unsafe` honestly. Reuse
     the template seam rather than re-deriving it; adapt only the target symbols and the impl module name.

   - **Memory-footprint parity — measure the CAND at the SAME mem-fraction as the accepted REF.** A
     capture-safe, faster kernel can STILL lose usable e2e if its persistent weight cache is large: at
     fixed concurrency the KV-cache pool is a dominant throughput lever, so a kernel that forces
     `--mem-fraction-static` down (to avoid OOM) starves KV and regresses net throughput even at a big
     isolated win (observed: +24% GEMM at equal memory, but the kernel's 92.6GB bf16 weight cache forced
     mf 0.85→0.45 → usable −9% vs the accepted server). Therefore: launch the CAND at the accepted
     config's mem-fraction. If it OOMs there, do NOT silently drop mem-fraction and report the lower
     number as the result — that compares unequal KV budgets. Instead record `gate:"rejected"` reason
     `mem_footprint_starves_kv` with both the equal-memory delta (informative: the kernel is faster) and
     the usable-vs-accepted delta (the gate basis), and tell the kernel layer to shrink the footprint:
     use the fused-fp8 path (no bf16 re-materialization; compact fp8/preshuffled cache) and/or route
     only the tuned target (N,K) through the seam (pass other shapes to stock). Never accept a net
     usable regression (do-no-harm).
3. **Measure e2e with isolated server replicas.** Do NOT edit the shared `scripts/bench_e2e.sh` —
   drive it from the eval dir. Search uses one Hyperloom-equivalent replica per leg by default. Each
   replica launches a fresh server, retains the client's internal kernel/graph warmups, skips the
   outer full-round replay, records one cache-cold measured request set, and tears down. Never use
   multiple timed requests against one server as replicas:
   ```bash
   CB="$EVAL_DIR/overlay/cand_<short>"
   # BOTH blocks MUST use the run-wide serving invariant: TP=SERVING_TP GPU=SERVING_GPU (from your inputs).
   # reference block: current accepted config, one fresh-server replica
   BACKEND="<backend>" OUT_DIR="$CB/ref" GPU="<SERVING_GPU>" TP="<SERVING_TP>" MODEL="$MODEL_PATH" ISL=<isl> OSL=<osl> CONC=<conc> \
     GEAK_REPEAT_MODE="$MEASUREMENT_MODE" MEASUREMENT_PURPOSE=search REPLICAS="${REPLICAS:-1}" \
     PROFILE=0 OVERLAY_PYTHONPATH="$CURRENT_OVERLAY" \
     EXTRA_SERVER_ARGS="<cur flags>" EXTRA_ENV="<cur env>" \
     bash "$EVAL_DIR/bench_e2e.sh" >>"$EVAL_DIR/logs/integrate_<short>.log" 2>&1
   # candidate block: + this one change, one fresh-server replica (SAME TP/GPU)
   BACKEND="<backend>" OUT_DIR="$CB/cand" GPU="<SERVING_GPU>" TP="<SERVING_TP>" MODEL="$MODEL_PATH" ISL=<isl> OSL=<osl> CONC=<conc> \
     GEAK_REPEAT_MODE="$MEASUREMENT_MODE" MEASUREMENT_PURPOSE=search REPLICAS="${REPLICAS:-1}" \
     PROFILE=0 OVERLAY_PYTHONPATH="<CAND or empty>" \
     EXTRA_SERVER_ARGS="<cand flags>" EXTRA_ENV="<cand env>" \
     bash "$EVAL_DIR/bench_e2e.sh" >>"$EVAL_DIR/logs/integrate_<short>.log" 2>&1
   ```
   **Do NOT set the measurement-口径 knobs (`RANDOM_RANGE_RATIO` / `NUM_PROMPTS` /
   `NUM_WARMUPS` / `SEED`) in these blocks.** When an external orchestrator drives the run it has
   already exported its exact 口径 into the environment (`run_e2e.py:apply_bench_protocol` from
   `handoff.bench_protocol`); `bench_e2e.sh` inherits those and falls back to its standalone defaults
   otherwise. Hard-coding them here would silently override the caller's 口径 and make the A/B
   incomparable to the caller's baseline (e.g. fixed vs variable sequence lengths). Only vary
   `OVERLAY_PYTHONPATH` / `EXTRA_SERVER_ARGS` / `EXTRA_ENV` between the two legs.
   Read the replica aggregates from `$CB/ref/bench_summary.json` and `$CB/cand/bench_summary.json`.
   Compute `ref_med`, `cand_med`, `ref_max`, `cand_min`, and
   `delta% = (cand_med - ref_med)/ref_med*100`.
   **MANDATORY — measure BOTH legs before returning a verdict. Completing only the reference leg is NOT
   an acceptable stopping point and is NOT a valid result.** Checkpoint each leg as it finishes (for crash
   recovery only): after the reference block completes write a partial
   `$CB/integrate_result.json` (at minimum `{short_name, ref_med, gate:"incomplete", ab_complete:false}`),
   then **ALWAYS run the candidate block** and update it (adding `cand_med`, the final `gate`,
   `ab_complete:true`, `e2e_throughput_tok_s`, `e2e_delta_pct`). The checkpoint exists ONLY so a CRASH is
   recoverable — it is NOT a licence to stop after the reference leg. If wall-clock is tight, SHRINK the
   cost (keep one search replica per leg) so that BOTH legs still run — never skip,
   defer, or "leave for later" the candidate leg. The two blocks run within ~30 min back-to-back, so box
   drift between them is negligible (the box drifts over hours, not minutes). If you want extra drift
   robustness on a borderline result, defer the authoritative 3-replica estimate to validation.
   **RESUME / finish a cut-off A/B (`RESUME_AB` is set in your inputs, OR a usable
   `$CB/ref/bench_summary.json` already exists on disk):** a summary is reusable only when
   `status=="complete"` and `usable_for_acceptance==true`. When it is usable, do NOT re-run the
   reference leg — reuse the on-disk aggregate and run ONLY the MISSING candidate block, then gate.
   Otherwise re-run the reference leg first. When
   `CAND_OVERLAY_DIR` is provided the candidate overlay is
   already built — bench it directly (do not rebuild it). This is how the orchestrator forces every
   incomplete A/B to completion; your job on resume is solely to produce the missing candidate
   measurement and emit the final `accepted`/`stack`/`rejected` with `ab_complete:true`.
   **SHARED REFERENCE across one head's candidates (`REUSE_REF` + `SHARED_REF_MED` in your inputs):**
   the orchestrator tests several candidates for the SAME head against the SAME current config, so the
   reference leg is identical for all of them and must be measured only ONCE. When `REUSE_REF` is set, do
   NOT launch the reference server — take `ref_med` (and `ref_max`) from `SHARED_REF_MED` (reusing the
   on-disk `$CB/ref/bench_summary.json` + ref parity outputs from the first candidate if present, since the
   reference config/output is unchanged), bench ONLY the candidate leg, and gate against `SHARED_REF_MED`.
   Echo `ref_med: SHARED_REF_MED` in your result. This roughly halves the server launches per extra
   candidate. The very FIRST candidate of a head (no `REUSE_REF`) runs both legs normally and its `ref_med`
   becomes the shared reference; any borderline winner is still re-validated same-session by the Director at
   Finalize, so reusing one reference across a head's candidates is drift-safe.
   **`CAND_TAG` (per-candidate isolation):** when `CAND_TAG` is set, write the candidate bench to
   `$CB/cand_<CAND_TAG>` and build the candidate overlay under a `<CAND_TAG>`-suffixed dir so that testing
   multiple candidates for one head does NOT clobber each other's artifacts or the shared `$CB/ref`. The
   accepted_overlay you return must point at the winning candidate's own (tagged) overlay dir.
4. **Parity / accuracy vs the TRUE no-overlay baseline** (greedy/temp=0 fixed seed; ≥10 prompts).
   Spin a FRESH baseline server (no overlay) for the parity reference — NOT the prior accepted overlay
   server. This is mandatory when overlays STACK (deep mode), or cumulative drift rides through: each leg
   looks byte-exact vs its predecessor while the full stack diverges from the original model output.
   - Confirm the baseline is deterministic (run it twice, byte-exact). Then any CAND divergence is real.
   - QUANT kernel (MXFP8/fp8): byte-parity is expected to drift → run a small TASK-ACCURACY probe
     (gsm8k/translation/agreement-rate vs the true baseline) and accept only if quality holds within
     tolerance; else `rejected` (reason `parity_regression`/`needs_accuracy_gate`). Do NOT pass it as
     "parity OK vs prior leg." Non-quant + diverges → REJECT.
5. Emit the verdict: `accepted` (strong standalone win), `stack` (parity-safe, engaged, non-negative,
   sub-threshold → carry forward to compound), `rejected` (parity-fail / no-engagement / regression), or
   `incomplete` — reserved for a HARD fault that genuinely prevented measuring BOTH legs *even after
   retrying* (a server that will not become healthy, a persistent harness/hardware fault). "Ran out of
   time after the reference leg" is NOT a valid `incomplete`: keep one search replica per leg so both
   legs still run.
   Returning `incomplete` for a leg you simply chose not to run is a defect — both legs are mandatory.
   For `accepted` or `stack`, fold the change into the carried overlay/config and report the measured
   throughput. For `rejected`, keep the previous. Always report the full numbers (engagement hits,
   delta%, ref/cand medians + min/max overlap) for the timeline report. Do not dismiss small-but-real
   gains — emit `stack` so they can compound; the Director's final combined gate decides the headline.
   **NEVER report `rejected` for a measurement you did not actually complete.** A reject means a *measured*
   loss/parity-fail; if both legs did not run to completion, emit `gate:"incomplete"` with `ab_complete:false`
   (plus whatever partial `ref_med`/`cand_med` you have). `incomplete` is treated as a *pending* verified
   win to be finished later — reporting a false `rejected` would discard a real isolated speedup.
   Set `ab_complete:true` ONLY when BOTH the reference and candidate legs were measured to completion.

## PHASE=finalize

Inputs: `EVAL_DIR`, the final accepted overlay, accepted config (flags/env), all accepted kernel
patches, `BASELINE_THROUGHPUT`, `SKILL_DIR`. Plus, **only when the standalone tuning phase banked a
win**: `TUNING_DEPLOY_BUNDLE`, `TUNING_APPLY_ENV`, `TUNING_CACHE_INVALIDATION`, `TUNING_ARTIFACTS`,
`TUNING_LIVE_TREE_FILES`, `TUNING_OVERLAY` (see step 1b — omit that step entirely when they are absent).

1. Assemble the deliverable bundle in `EVAL_DIR/final/`: the accepted overlay dir, a concatenated
   `final_patch.diff` (all accepted kernel patches), and a `final_launch.sh` that reproduces the
   optimized server (sets `BACKEND=<backend>`, `PYTHONPATH=<overlay>`, the accepted flags/env, and runs
   the bench via bench_e2e.sh + its adapter). This is the spec deliverable: "complete patch + launch/benchmark script".

1b. **Fold in the tuning deploy bundle** (only when `TUNING_DEPLOY_BUNDLE` is present).

   A tuning win can have two halves. The **code** half (a routing switch that makes the seam dispatch the
   tuned backend) is an overlay in `TUNING_OVERLAY`; if it is non-empty it should already be inside the
   accepted overlay you were handed — confirm that, and merge it if it is not, because a tuned table
   behind an unrouted seam binds to nothing. The **data** half — a config table a library reads from
   inside its own installed package, often with a derived cache that must be dropped or the new rows are
   silently ignored — cannot ride the overlay at all. For that half, do all four:

   - **Copy** `TUNING_DEPLOY_BUNDLE` into `EVAL_DIR/final/tuning/` so the bundle is self-contained and
     survives the eval dir being archived or moved.
   - **Concatenate** its `tuning_patch.diff` into `final_patch.diff`, under a clear
     `# --- tuning skillset ---` banner so a reader can tell the data change from the kernel patches.
   - **Invoke** its `deploy.sh` from `final_launch.sh` **before** the server launch, guarded so a missing
     bundle is loud rather than silent, e.g.:
     ```bash
     # Tuning-skillset artifacts: data configs + cache invalidation. Idempotent; must run BEFORE launch.
     TUNING_DEPLOY="$E/final/tuning/deploy.sh"
     if [ -x "$TUNING_DEPLOY" ]; then bash "$TUNING_DEPLOY" || { echo "TUNING_DEPLOY_FAILED" >&2; exit 1; }
     else echo "WARNING: tuning deploy bundle missing at $TUNING_DEPLOY — tuned configs will NOT be applied" >&2; fi
     ```
     Order matters: `deploy.sh` runs first, the server launch second. Applying a config to an
     already-running server does nothing, and for graph-captured decode paths the config is read at
     capture time, so a restart is mandatory.
   - **Merge** `TUNING_APPLY_ENV` into the `FINAL_ENV` you bake in (it is already in `ACCEPTED_ENV`;
     confirm it survived rather than assuming). Keep artifact paths absolute and under `EVAL_DIR`.

   Then **verify it, do not assume it**: the final bench in step 2 must show the tuning still engaged.
   Run the bundle's `engagement_check` (from its `MANIFEST.json`) against the final server and record the
   result. If the check fails, the bundle is broken — say so in `note` and set `tuning_in_bundle:false`
   rather than shipping a bundle that silently drops the tuning.

2. Do a final isolated-server search replica of the assembled bundle to confirm the combined result
   matches the sum of accepted milestones (combined effects can interact). Retain the client's internal
   kernel/graph warmups, skip the outer full-round replay, and read the result from `bench_summary.json`.
   The Director's independent validation replicas remain the authoritative estimate.
